Any source and documentation of this website, and generally any MDE's implementations
referenced here, is *open source*. As the goal is to build a reference of Markdown's
syntax usage, it has to keep free of use and accept any kind of external contribution.

We keep [here](06-downloads.html) a **non-exhaustive** list of various implementations
in different programing languages. If you have a parser of the Markdown Extended syntax
and you want to add it on this website, please [learn how to do so](05-dvelopers-doc.html).
